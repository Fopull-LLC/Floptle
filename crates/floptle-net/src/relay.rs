//! The rendezvous relay: hosts register and get a lobby code, clients join
//! with the code, and the relay forwards opaque session traffic both ways.
//! Nobody port-forwards; the only reachable address anyone needs is the
//! relay's. This is the open, self-hostable reference implementation; Floptle
//! Cloud runs the managed one.
//!
//! Everything rides the quic transport: an endpoint's leg to the relay is an
//! ordinary [`QuicClient`], the relay itself an ordinary [`QuicServer`].
//! Control and reliable game traffic go on the framed stream, ordered, so a
//! `Join` is always processed before the session's `Hello` that follows it;
//! unreliable game traffic goes as datagrams.
//!
//! Sequenced drops are end-to-end: the sender stamps a `seq` inside the
//! relayed message and the final receiver drops stale ones per
//! `(peer, channel)`. The legs carry unreliable datagrams without per-leg
//! dedup, so interleaved traffic for different peers never false-drops.
//!
//! [`RelayServer`] knows lobbies, peer ids and forwarding, and nothing else:
//! a session over a relay is the same bytes as a direct one.
