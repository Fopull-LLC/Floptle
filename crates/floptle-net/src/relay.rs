//! The rendezvous relay (`docs/multiplayer.md` §10): hosts register and get
//! a **lobby code**; clients join with the code; the relay forwards opaque
//! session traffic both ways. Nobody port-forwards — the only reachable
//! address anyone needs is the relay's. This is the open, self-hostable
//! reference implementation (ADR-0022); Floptle Cloud runs the managed one.
//!
//! Everything rides the QUIC transport this crate already has: an endpoint's
//! leg to the relay is an ordinary [`QuicClient`], the relay itself an
//! ordinary [`QuicServer`] — control + reliable game traffic on the framed
//! stream (ordered, so a `Join` is always processed before the session's
//! `Hello` that follows it), unreliable game traffic as datagrams.
//!
//! Sequenced-drop semantics are END-TO-END: the sender stamps a `seq` inside
//! the relayed message and the FINAL receiver drops stale ones per
//! `(peer, channel)` — the legs themselves carry unreliable datagrams without
//! per-leg dedup, so interleaved traffic for different peers can never
//! false-drop.
//!
//! [`RelayServer`] is deliberately dumb: lobbies, peer ids, forwarding. No
//! game state, no inspection — a session over a relay is the same bytes as a
//! direct one.
