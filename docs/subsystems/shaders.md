> **Fragment stage** — `Material.shader` names a `.flsl`, one pipeline per

> beside the built-in look (which stays byte-identical when unused); **Sdf
> stage** — a **Field Shape** node's shader IS its geometry, spliced into
> `map_d`/`map` (renders, casts/receives shadows + AO, up to 4 per scene,
> visual-only until the CPU evaluator); the **tiling block** (UV
> count/offset/rotation + triplanar, per binding, both paths); Inspector rows
> generated from `uniform`/`texture` declarations; mtime hot reload with
> last-good-pipeline fallback; `.flsl` syntax highlighting, live squiggles and
> a stdlib Docs section in the Scripting tab; `◈ New Shader` in Assets.
> Divergences from this pre-spec: stdlib identifiers are **camelCase**, the
> stage is named `sdf` (not raymarch), and `Vertex`/light/post stages are
> reserved (proposal §9). Probes: `shader_probe`, `field_shape_probe`.

This is Floptle's biggest lever for visuals nobody else can make (see
[VISION](../VISION.md) §4.2). We *own the representation*, so we can add
non-standard nodes — raymarch/SDF warps, feedback, impossible color transport —
that drive the otherworldly look. We start with a usable subset and grow the
stdlib.

## 1. The IR is the single source of truth

A shader is a graph of **nodes** connected by **edges** through **typed ports**.
Every authoring view is a projection of this one structure; nothing lives only in
the graph or only in the text.

```rust
enum PortType { Float, Vec2, Vec3, Vec4, Color, Sampler, Sdf }

struct Port { name: String, ty: PortType }

struct Node {
    id:     NodeId,
    op:     OpKind,                 // "noise.fbm", "sdf.mandelbox", "color.palette", ...
    params: BTreeMap<String, Const>,// inline constants (RON-serialized)
    inputs: Vec<Port>,
    outputs: Vec<Port>,
}

struct Edge { from: (NodeId, PortIdx), to: (NodeId, PortIdx) }

struct ShaderIr {
    stage:    Stage,                // Fragment | Vertex | Raymarch
    uniforms: Vec<Uniform>,         // time, params, exposed material knobs
    inputs:   Vec<VertexInput>,     // uv, world_pos, normal, ...
    nodes:    Vec<Node>,
    edges:    Vec<Edge>,
    output:   NodeId,               // the single Output node (sink)
}
```

The graph is a **DAG** with one **Output** node as the sink. Type-checking is
edge-level: a `Color` output may feed a `Vec4` input (widening), an `Sdf` port
only connects to SDF-aware inputs. The IR is RON-serialized like everything else
authored in Floptle.

## 2. Two synchronized views

```
   ┌─────────────┐   print (.flsl)   ┌──────────────┐
   │  NODE GRAPH │ ────────────────▶ │  .flsl  TEXT │
   │  (in editor)│ ◀──────────────── │  (in VSCode) │
   └──────┬──────┘   parse (.flsl)   └──────┬───────┘
          │                                 │
          └──────────────┬──────────────────┘
                   same  ShaderIr
                         │
                     transpile → WGSL → naga validate → renderer
```

Both views are lossless projections of `ShaderIr`. Press **Open in VSCode**
(ADR-0011: `code <projectRoot> --goto <file>.flsl`) and the graph is *printed* to
`.flsl`; edit and save and it's *parsed* back into the identical IR. Round-trip
is structural, not textual: we print from the IR, parse into the IR, and the
graph re-lays out — so AI/manual text edits and graph edits are interchangeable.

### A small `.flsl` example

A swirling, palette-cycled plasma over UV space:

```flsl
shader plasma {
  stage fragment
  uniform time: float
  in uv: vec2

  let warped = domain_warp(uv, scale: 3.0, time: time);     // space-melt
  let n      = fbm(warped, octaves: 5);                      // noise field
  let hue    = hue_shift(palette(n, "sunset"), time * 0.1);  // nostalgic cycle
  let final  = posterize(hue, steps: 6);                     // retro quantize

  output color = final;
}
```

`let` bindings are nodes; named arguments (`scale:`, `octaves:`) are params or
edges; `output` is the sink node. The printer emits this from the graph; the
parser rebuilds the graph from it. Both reduce to the same `ShaderIr`.

## 3. Transpile to WGSL

`ShaderIr` → **WGSL** in one pass: topo-sort the DAG, emit each node's WGSL
snippet binding its inputs to upstream SSA temporaries, declare uniforms/inputs,
write the Output node to the stage's return. The result is handed to **naga** for
validation (ADR-0002 ships it) before the renderer builds a pipeline. naga errors
map back to node ids / `.flsl` lines for in-editor diagnostics.

```
ShaderIr ─▶ topo sort ─▶ emit WGSL per node ─▶ naga validate ─▶ pipeline/material
                                                    │
                                              errors → node id / .flsl:line
```

Raymarch-stage shaders emit a `map(p, t)` distance function consumed by the
renderer's raymarch pass ([`./renderer.md`](./renderer.md) §3) rather than a
fragment color — same IR, different output contract.

## 4. Stdlib node categories

Start small (the ADR-0007 subset), grow over time. Categories, with examples:

- **Inputs / uniforms** — `time`, `uv`, `world_pos`, `normal`, `camera_pos`,
  `camera_dir`, `resolution`, plus material-exposed knobs.
- **Math / vector ops** — `add/mul/mix`, `dot/cross/normalize`, `length`,
  `clamp/smoothstep`, `sin/cos`, swizzles, splits/combines.
- **Noise** — `perlin`, `simplex`, `worley`, `fbm` (octaves/lacunarity/gain).
- **SDF** — primitives (`sphere`, `box`, `torus`) and fractals (`mandelbulb`,
  `mandelbox`, `menger`, `kleinian`); operators `union`/`subtract`/`intersect`,
  `smooth_min`, and **domain warps** (`twist`, `bend`, `repeat`, `domain_warp`).
  These let shaders **author raymarched looks**, feeding §5's raymarch hook.
- **Color** — `hue_shift`, `palette` (named/LUT), `posterize`, `gamma`,
  `contrast`, `to_hsv`/`from_hsv`.
- **Texture sampling** — `sample(tex, uv)` honoring the material's **tiling
  options** (repeat/clamp/flip/count) so "drag on and tile" needs no shader edit;
  see [`./materials-and-textures.md`](./materials-and-textures.md).

### 4.1 Hooks into the raymarch pass

A `Raymarch` output node packages an `Sdf` graph as the `map()` function the
renderer marches, plus optional shade/normal hooks. This is how a shader authored
in the editor becomes a fly-through fractal: the SDF subgraph *is* the world.

```flsl
shader inside_box {
  stage raymarch
  uniform time: float

  let f = smooth_min(mandelbox(world_pos, power: 8.0, time: time),
                     sphere(world_pos, r: 2.0), k: 0.3);
  output sdf = f;          // becomes map(p, t) for the raymarch pass
}
```

## 5. Materials reference a compiled shader

A **material** binds a compiled shader plus its **param block** (uniform values,
texture slots, tiling). Many materials can share one shader with different params;
changing a param is a uniform write, not a recompile. Full design and the RON
shape live in [`./materials-and-textures.md`](./materials-and-textures.md).

```
material "lava.ron" ─▶ shader "plasma.flsl" (compiled WGSL)
                    └▶ params { time: <driven>, palette: "sunset", tex: lava.png ×3 }
```

## 6. Editor UX

- **Graph editor** — drag nodes from a categorized palette, wire typed ports
  (type-checked, colored by `PortType`), edit inline constants. Same dark /
  high-contrast / retro theme as the rest of the editor (VISION §6).
- **Open in VSCode** — a button at the top of the graph prints the current IR to
  `.flsl` and opens it in VSCode at the project root (ADR-0011). Edit with AI or
  by hand; on save the graph re-syncs from the file.
- **Live preview** — a preview viewport (quad, mesh, or a small raymarch volume)
  recompiles on edit and shows the result immediately; naga errors surface inline
  on the offending node / `.flsl` line.

## 7. Out of scope (day one)

- Full **GLSL/HLSL feature parity** — we ship a usable subset and grow the stdlib.
- Geometry/tessellation/mesh shaders, arbitrary compute kernels authored in-graph
  (the renderer's compute passes are hand-written for now).
- Multi-pass shader *graphs* spanning render targets — that's the render graph's
  job ([`./renderer.md`](./renderer.md) §1), not a single shader's.

If a node doesn't help make something nobody's seen, it waits.
